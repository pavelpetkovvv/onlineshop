# OnlineShop

*solution to assignment for Software Engineer Intern position at Progress*

## Overview

The project represent a simple online shop (currently for food products). The products are displayed in the `shop` section of the website as cells which show name, price and picture of the product. By clicking on the picture more details for the product are displayed.

The products in the `shop` section are created dynamically by the JavaScrip code of the website. The window that displays on click on the image of given product is also dinamically created.

The details of the products are stored in JSON array which due to the lack of backend of the website is found in the JavaScript code.
